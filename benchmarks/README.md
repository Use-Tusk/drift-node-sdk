# Benchmarks

These are some benchmarks.
Each benchmark is actually just a AVA test suite that uses tinybench for
measurements and formatting.
At the start of each test suite, we launch a server in `server/test-server.ts`.
Interestingly, it is this server that does all the work rather than the actual
benchmark files.

## Usage

You can run all tests and get a summary with
```
npm run test:bench
```
